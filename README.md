## 🛡️ Professional Profile

I am a Security Professional specializing in **Security Operations (SOC)** and **Network Defense**, with a deep focus on the **Ransomware Lifecycle**. I bridge the gap between high-level monitoring and low-level system engineering. 

My expertise combines real-time threat detection (SIEM/Log Analysis) with the ability to dissect malware behavior using **C/C++, Rust, and Java**. I am dedicated to building resilient perimeters against lateral movement and exfiltration, while researching **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)** to mitigate "Store Now, Decrypt Later" threats in critical infrastructures.
