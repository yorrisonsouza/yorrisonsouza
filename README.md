## 🛡️ Professional Profile

I operate at the intersection of **offensive development** and **reverse engineering**, dedicated to deciphering the internal mechanics of modern malware to architect next-generation defenses. My core philosophy is rooted in the belief that to build a resilient system, one must first master the art of subversion.

My primary research is focused on **MADEC**, an immuno-inspired detection engine designed to neutralize sophisticated threats, including polymorphic malware and AI-optimized exploits. By pivoting between **C/C++, Rust, and Java**, I bridge the gap from Ring 3 to Ring 0, ensuring the integrity of the Operating System's "ground truth."

## 🔬 Offensive Engineering & Malware Research

* **Offensive Development (PoCs):** Developing Proof-of-Concepts focused on evasion techniques, advanced process injection (Process Hollowing, Ptrace), and stealthy persistence.
* **Reverse Engineering:** Performing static and dynamic binary analysis to deconstruct custom encryption algorithms and Command & Control (C2) communication protocols.
* **Hooking & Hijacking:** Expertise in intercepting system calls (syscalls) and dynamic library loading via `LD_PRELOAD` and inline hooking.
* **Ransomware Mechanics:** In-depth study of the cryptoware lifecycle, focusing on thwarting lateral movement and data exfiltration before the final encryption phase.

## 🤖 AI & Immunological Defense (Project MADEC)

* **MADEC (Immuno-inspired Detection):** Developing a proactive defense mechanism that mimics biological immune systems to identify behavioral anomalies in real-time.
* **AI-Driven Threat Hunting:** Researching machine learning models to identify attack patterns generated by adversarial AI, such as automated exploit generation and network deepfakes.
* **Heuristic Analysis:** Moving beyond signature-based detection toward deep behavioral and heuristic mapping.

---

## 🔐 Post-Quantum & Network Engineering

* **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC):** Implementing and benchmarking lattice-based algorithms (Kyber/Dilithium) to mitigate "Store Now, Decrypt Later" threats.
* **Secure Networking:** Architecting hardened WireGuard tunnels with hybrid quantum-safe encryption layers for critical infrastructure protection.

## 🧪 Featured Security Projects

### 👻 [GhostFile-Rootkit-PoC](https://github.com/yorrisonsouza/GhostFile-Rootkit-PoC)
A study on **Userland Rootkits** using `LD_PRELOAD` hooking in C. This project demonstrates artifact cloaking techniques and the forensic methodologies required for detection.

### 🧬 [MADEC - Immuno-Detection System]
My flagship project: A proactive detection engine utilizing immunological logic to identify and neutralize malicious behaviors before they escalate into incidents.

### ⚛️ [Post-Quantum VPN Research]
A prototype PQC-enabled VPN tunnel testing the performance overhead of lattice-based algorithms in **Industrial Automation (OT)** environments.
