## About Me

I am a SOC Analyst (N1) focused on security monitoring, log analysis, and incident triage within defensive security operations. I work with SIEM-based detection, MITRE ATT&CK mapping, and foundational incident response activities.

Alongside my SOC role, I study Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) to understand how quantum threats impact cryptographic systems such as TLS, VPNs, and digital certificates. My focus is practical and strategic, centered on cryptographic risk assessment, algorithm transition, and long-term data protection against store-now, decrypt-later scenarios.

I also maintain foundational knowledge of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), with an emphasis on real-world constraints and niche applications in high-value and inter-regional communication links.

In parallel, I have experience in secure backend development using Java and Spring Boot, and I am gradually expanding into automation and industrial robotics with a focus on software-driven motion control rather than mechanical engineering.
